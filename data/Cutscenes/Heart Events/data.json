    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/31": "Well, it certainly gave you your taste for archaeology at any rate.",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/37": "In my wardrobe. When I moved in I just shoved everything still in there as far back as it would go.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/38": "Can you believe it, [Ari]? The third piece of the Dragonsworn Armor! Were there any notes with it? A storage box?",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/4": "In this very house.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/40": "I was afraid of this.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/41": "With no clues, it will make the next piece that much harder to find.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/42": "Maybe it's recorded somewhere in the annals of the house? Those go back hundreds of years.",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/49": "Just so! I'm going to get a bottle of that very old wine from down cellar.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/5": "I believe we are looking for the Dragonsworn Cloak, a truly excellent example of \"Dynweaving\" that imparted the cloth with incredible durability.",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/6": "Legends say it could turn aside swords, and even arrows couldn't pierce it.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/7": "However, at some point the cloak became a symbol of the leader of Mistria. As fashion sensibilities changed, well...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/8": "Frankly, I think it ended up tucked away in some odd corner of the house.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/9": "Luckily for us, nothing ever gets thrown away around here.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/init": "Thank you for coming, [Ari].",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_six_hearts/eiland_six_hearts/init/prompts/0": "Where are we off to? Ancient ruins? A forgotten temple?",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/1": "Magnificent, isn't it? It's very old, certainly older than the town around it. You can find steles like this all over the country, although ours is in particularly good shape.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/1/prompts/0": "Stele?",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/13": "This will take time to translate... Can you hand me the greaves, [Ari]?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/14": "Thank you. Now to get these to the museum!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/2": "An ancient monument. They were put up for all sorts of reasons. Memorials, to mark boundaries, or to commemorate great events.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/3": "Wouldn't that be nice! However, people who hide treasure usually don't mark it so obviously.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/4": "Our stele depicts a legendary set of armor, worn by someone called the Dragonsworn. It's quite unique!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/5": "Supposedly the Dragonsworn was a nearly mythical being who aided the dragons in the ancient days of the world. Could you imagine!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/5/prompts/0": "Y-you don't say!",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/6": "Of course, legends do tend to be full of, well, legendary figures. The truth of the matter has been lost.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/7": "Very funny! I'd settle just for finding their armor!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts/8": "Although the armor and the details around the Dragonsworn have been lost to us, thanks to this stele, we do have some clues. Come here!",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts_follow_up_1/1": "I'll let you know as soon as I'm done translating the new text. Could you imagine if it led us to another piece of the armor?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts_follow_up_1/init": "I don't know if the earthquake dislodged something from the mechanism in the stele, or if it was just luck, but I can't thank you enough.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Eiland/eiland_two_hearts/eiland_two_hearts_follow_up_2/init": "[Ari]! Would you look at you! A find like a piece of the Dragonsworn's Armor set is every archaeologist's dream!",
