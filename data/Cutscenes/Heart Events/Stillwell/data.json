    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Stillwell/stillwell_two_hearts/stillwell_two_hearts/12": "Ooh, a challenge. Sounds like you want Hemlock's patented Ditchwater cocktail!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Stillwell/stillwell_two_hearts/stillwell_two_hearts/13": "Suggest a different drink!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Stillwell/stillwell_two_hearts/stillwell_two_hearts/13/prompts/0": "You look upset, Juniper. Tell you what, your drink is on me!",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Stillwell/stillwell_two_hearts/stillwell_two_hearts/5/prompts/1": "Why don't you save it as a snack for later, Adeline?",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Stillwell/stillwell_two_hearts/stillwell_two_hearts/9": "Good work. The sugar rush from that second slice would have caused Adeline to have a sugar crash later today...",
