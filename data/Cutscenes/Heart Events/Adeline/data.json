    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_four_hearts/adeline_four_hearts/8": "Why I'm sure you yourself have some projects these supplies would help speed along!",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_six_hearts/adeline_six_hearts/2": "Still, those are just the things people bring to me. It's important to take a more direct approach when it comes to assessing how the town is doing.",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_six_hearts/adeline_six_hearts/8": "Don't forget that taking care of Mistria includes taking care of yourself. Right [Ari]?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_six_hearts/adeline_six_hearts/9": "Ah... but there's still a lot of ground to cover.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_six_hearts/adeline_six_hearts/extra_0": "It's sweet of Landen to look out for me, but really... I'm okay!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_six_hearts/adeline_six_hearts/extra_1": "I just need to make sure I'm keeping on top of everything.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_six_hearts/adeline_six_hearts/extra_1/prompts/0": "Maybe we should take a break?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_six_hearts/adeline_six_hearts/extra_1/prompts/1": "Really, the town is doing great!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_six_hearts/adeline_six_hearts/init": "There you are, [Ari]. I'm so glad you could make it!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/1": "Welcome to the party, dear!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/10": "And I'm handling our tax documents for the season! Sorry to hog the really fun work, everyone!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/11": "[Ari], I'd like you to come over here and review the work we've already done. It'll give you a good overview and make sure we haven't made any mistakes!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/12": "But you've already double checked everything, Adeline.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/13": "Nothing better than a triple check, it's so satisfying!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/13/prompts/0": "Wow, thanks Adeline!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/13/prompts/1": "Wow, uh, thanks Adeline...",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/15": "Haha, well, I appreciate that you're willing to give it a try.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/16": "And when we're done, I've ordered up a special tray of treats from the Inn to celebrate! Whoever finishes first gets first pick!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/17": "Well, why didn't you say so earlier!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/2": "Oh no, I hope Adeline didn't bully you into this, [Ari].",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/3": "Nonsense! Not all of us are as averse to paperwork as you, Eiland. Right, [Ari]?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/3/prompts/0": "I love the smell of drying ink!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/3/prompts/1": "Well, I guess I'm about to find out!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/4": "Oh! Me too!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/5": "I'm sure you'll have a great time!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/6": "Let me take you around the room. Great Aunt Elsie is working on applying for grants from the Capital...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/7": "There's certainly a trick to getting what you want out of those nobles. Unfortunately for them, I've had plenty of practice!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/8": "My dear brother is taking care of large excavation site procedural paperwork...",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Adeline/adeline_two_hearts/adeline_two_hearts/9": "Honestly, with the archaic way these forms have been written, you'd think they were historical artifacts themselves!",
