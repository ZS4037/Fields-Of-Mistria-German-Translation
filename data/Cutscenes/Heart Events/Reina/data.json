    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_four_hearts/reina_four_hearts/13": "You need a bit of a knack to find them, Nora and I used to pick them as kids! You can eat 'em raw, but they're great sauteed, fried, really any which way.",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/11": "I am, and I come bearing some interesting news. The final judge for the Cooking Panel has been selected.",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/29": "That's right! I've heard extra sweet curry is popular in the Capital. I went with a lot more honey than usual!",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/30": "I should have started with that, this chocolate cake is... spicy?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/30/prompts/0": "That's the layer of chili-infused ganache!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/30/prompts/1": "It adds a bold kick, right?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/31": "Mom always told us to have dessert last, I've learned my lesson.",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/34": "We mixed in agar to make it richer and thicker. Taliferro's restaurant is well-known for incorporating innovative textures to its menu!",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/35": "So what does everyone think?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/36": "Well, it does all taste like something Taliferro might serve...",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/41": "Well thanks for taste testing, everyone. [Ari] and I better get this all cleaned up. Does anyone want leftovers?",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/45": "Yeah, I suppose Eiland might like it.",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/46": "Maybe Maple is right. We didn't really showcase Mistrian cooking today, did we?",
    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/47": "I'm not really sure which direction to go in anymore. This is going to be even harder than I thought.",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_six_hearts/reina_six_hearts/50": "Take some of this $Honey Curry$ home with you. We made WAY too much!",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_two_hearts/reina_two_hearts/11": "I've got a lot of work to do to get ready. New dishes to test and perfect, and that's with keeping on top of running the Inn's kitchen to boot...",

    "Cutscenes/Heart Events/Reina/reina_two_hearts/reina_two_hearts/16": "Yeah, you two are right! Now, how about I cut us all some fresh slices of pie?",
