    "Cutscenes/Story Events/prologue/prologue/12": "Mistria is such a beautiful place! The small town charm, the rich history of the area, the rolling farmland-",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/prologue/prologue/13": "That's it! The old farm south of town!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/prologue/prologue/14": "Why don't we send a notice to the adventurer's guild in the Capital?",

    "Cutscenes/Story Events/prologue/prologue/8": "And even made plans to replenish our emergency stockpile by the end of summer!",
