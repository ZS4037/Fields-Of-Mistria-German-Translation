    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/10": "Lord Eiland! Look who I found out at the edge of the forest!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/11": "[Ari], I presume! Welcome, welcome! I'm Eiland, it's wonderful to meet you!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/12": "You're in good hands, [Ari]. I'm off to the inn, it's been a long day and I need a hot meal. I'll see you around!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/13": "So what do you think? Nice isn't it? You're right outside of town, great soil for farming...",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/14": "And look at this house! Four stout walls with a rich history! Let's go inside, shall we?",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/15": "Ah-",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/16": "J-just a minute!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/17": "It, er, appears we're not quite ready for you.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/18": "But not to worry! I'm sure she'll only need a moment.",

    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/18/prompts/1": "I'm used to roughing it, honestly.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/19": "No need!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/2": "I'm Balor, a traveling merchant. Pleased to meet you.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/20": "Ahaha...",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/21": "You must be [Ari]! I'm Adeline, thank you so much for answering my request!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/22": "My brother and I are so excited to have a real adventurer here to help the town.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/23": "I hope you like your new farm! It has a lot of potential, don't you think?",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/24": "Why don't you come inside?",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/25": "Welcome to your new home!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/25/prompts/0": "How cozy!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/25/prompts/1": "Wow, that was fast!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/26": "I'm glad you think so!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/27": "Haha...",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/28": "Would you like a quick tour of the room?",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/28/prompts/0": "Yes, please!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/28/prompts/1": "I'm good!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/29": "Wonderful!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/3": "Let me guess, you're here at Lady Adeline's request? She mentioned someone had taken her up on her offer.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/3/prompts/0": "She said she was looking for a \"capable adventurer\"!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/3/prompts/1": "There was something about free land and a house...",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/30": "Of course!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/31": "This here is your $Diary$! You can write in it when you want to $record your story$.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/32": "And this of course is your new $Bed$!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/33": "Make sure you get to sleep by $2 am$ each day to keep your $Stamina$ up.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/34": "We've also put this $Calendar$ up for you. You can use it to check when Mistria holds its $Festivals$ and to check when everyone in town's $Birthdays$ are!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/35": "And this $Storage Chest$ here was made by Mistria's very own carpenter, Ryis!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/36": "You can $store items$ here if your bag starts to get too full.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/37": "And that's about it for your tour!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/38": "I thought you might be hungry when you got here, so I stopped by the inn and picked up a bowl of their famous $Vegetable Soup$!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/39": "Well I'm sure you're worn out from your long day. We won't keep you up.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/4": "We sure could use one! There's a lot to do to get Mistria back on its feet.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/40": "Welcome to Mistria, [Ari]. We're so glad to have you!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/41": "Let's meet up tomorrow so we can start discussing our plans for the town restoration.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/5": "I've seen the area! It's a lovely spot, quite close to town.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/6": "I'll walk with you the rest of the way, if you don't mind the company. No wagons can get through since the bridge collapsed, so I've had to carry what I can on foot.",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/7": "Great, let's go!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/8": "Whew!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/9": "We should be able to make it before it gets dark. Come on, we'll head straight to your new farmstead!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/day_zero/day_zero/init": "Hello there!"
