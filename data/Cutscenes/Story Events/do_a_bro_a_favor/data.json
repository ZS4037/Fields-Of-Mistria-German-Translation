    "Cutscenes/Story Events/do_a_bro_a_favor/do_a_bro_a_favor/11": "Oh? If getting a handout from my brother counts as a \"special request\" I'm not sure I'd go bragging about it.",

    "Cutscenes/Story Events/do_a_bro_a_favor/do_a_bro_a_favor/init": "Ah, here we are!",
    "Cutscenes/Story Events/do_a_bro_a_favor/do_a_bro_a_favor/init/prompts/0": "So you must be the blacksmith.",

    "Cutscenes/Story Events/do_a_bro_a_favor/do_a_bro_a_favor_followup/3": "The Mines were badly damaged, and our $Town Rank$ sunk. That, along with... well...",

    "Cutscenes/Story Events/do_a_bro_a_favor/do_a_bro_a_favor_turn_in/init": "Thanks for taking my request, [Ari]! Now where did I put that $Pickaxe$..."
