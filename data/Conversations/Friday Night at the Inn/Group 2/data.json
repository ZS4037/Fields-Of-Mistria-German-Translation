    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/2": "Terithia! What a question! Let's see...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/3": "Balor enjoys his luxuries far too much, so he wouldn't last a day. Eiland, too. Our lord would expire without a slice of cake before bedtime.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/4": "Oh, they might surprise you. But I wouldn't say either is my first pick.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/5": "Holt would simply perish if he didn't have someone else to hear his jokes. On the other hand, Adeline would have the island organized in short order.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/6": "Aye, that girl's no stranger to rolling up her sleeves. What do you think, [Ari]? Anyone in mind?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/6/prompts/0": "Reina! She can make a meal out of anything!",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/7": "My thoughts exactly.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/8": "Unlike me, [Ari]. Can you imagine, ME on a deserted island? I would simply give up.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1/9": "He's like you, isn't he? He'd have some crops going and animals befriended before the week was out.",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1_follow_up_hayden/1": "Is that their way of telling me I should take a vacation?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1_follow_up_hayden/init": "Juniper and Terithia flagged me down earlier, asking how I'd cultivate a deserted island.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1_follow_up_reina/1": "Anyway, I gave them Papa's tropical punch recipe and they seemed really happy!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_1/balcony_1_follow_up_reina/init": "Juniper and Terithia have been asking for island recipes. Are they going on vacation?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/1": "It's a perfectly normal thing to wonder about! Who in Mistria would make the best frog?",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/11": "Oh. Yes. It seems so obvious when you put it like that.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/12": "It really fits, doesn't it?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/13": "But I've got our real answer. It's Errol! Have you seen that man's legs in a bathing suit?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/2": "March would run through all his energy trying to jump higher than the other frogs. Landen would croak up a storm and drive the rest off.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/3": "What about Ryis? He seems the type to be content with the simple life.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/4": "He's a city boy, Juniper. No frogs in the city.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/5": "Surely you've got some thoughts, [Ari]! Who do you think would make the best frog?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/5/prompts/0": "Juniper! The bathhouse is like your pond!",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/7": "I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that, [Ari].",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/8": "Now now, I think you'd make an adorable little frog. One of those poisonous ones.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/9": "Besides, we all know the real answer. It has to be Errol! Have you seen that man's legs in a bathing suit?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2/init": "Ahoy there, [Ari]! Help me answer Juniper's strange question.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2_follow_up_errol/1": "You wouldn't happen to know why, would you?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2_follow_up_errol/2": "Ah, I can tell by your expression that I shouldn't pursue the matter further.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_2/balcony_2_follow_up_errol/init": "[Ari], I couldn't help but notice that Terithia and Juniper were both pointing at me the other night.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/1": "Who here would make the best pirate?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/2": "Oho, I was born to answer this question. Errol would look dashing with a tricorn hat, but he gets a tad seasick. Hemlock strikes me as a right salty dog.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/3": "And Nora would make a fearful captain, but a fair one. Oh, it's difficult to choose!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/4": "March has that look in his eye that says everyone is his enemy. He might even pull off an eyepatch.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/5": "What do you think, [Ari]?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/5/prompts/0": "Dell, Maple and Luc! They play pirates all the time.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/5/prompts/1": "Elsie! She'd plunder everyone's hearts!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/6": "I have to throw in with [Ari] on this one, Terithia. They're half pirate already!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/7": "Mistria's original rapscallions.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/8": "She does have a heart of adventure.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/9": "She'd be the siren of the sea! No one could resist her charms.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3/init": "Now Terithia, I've put a lot of thought into this question, so I hope you'll take it seriously. Same to you, [Ari].",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3_follow_up_elsie/1": "I can't say I have, but there's always time.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3_follow_up_elsie/init": "Juniper asked if I'd ever romanced a pirate, and Terithia asked me the same thing later.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3_follow_up_kids/1": "Well, I'm adorable, and Dell would make a great pirate.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3_follow_up_kids/2": "Arrrrr matey!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_3/balcony_3_follow_up_kids/init": "Juniper said we would make adorable pirates.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/1": "Sorcerers? That's a fairy tale, Juniper.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/10": "Hmm. Bet he could.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/11": "I can see it. She has a curious mind, and an eye for herbs, which are two of the basic tenets of potion-making.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/12": "But I frankly don't think she could pull off the wardrobe.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/13": "Hmm. Bet she could.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/2": "Of course, of course. But Terithia, we proposed starting a pirate crew last week! Work with me here.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/3": "Fair enough. Let's see now, Eiland's read a lot of old books about the Witch Queens... but I'd say that's where his interest ends.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/4": "March has a knack for creating things, but he's a bit rigid otherwise.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/5": "Josephine does give me pause. She has a way of moving through the world.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/6": "What about Valen?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/7": "I won't even dignify that with a response. [Ari], speak up! Your thoughts are wanted. And no picking yourself!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/7/prompts/0": "Hayden! Henrietta is like his familiar!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/7/prompts/1": "Celine! The way her flowers bloom is magical!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/8": "Interesting. And I do see it. He has a strong connection to his animals, and a connection to the land as well.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/9": "But I frankly don't think he could pull off the wardrobe.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4/init": "My, look at all those people down there. We've got a full house. I wonder which of them would make the best sorcerer?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4_follow_up_celine/1": "I think she agreed a little too quickly, though!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4_follow_up_celine/init": "Juniper asked if I wanted her old hand-me-downs. I told her thank you, but they're not really my style...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4_follow_up_hayden/1": "When I asked if she wanted to be MY assistant, she looked like she might faint! Well, I doubt she has the shoes for it anyway.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balcony/balcony_4/balcony_4_follow_up_hayden/init": "Juniper asked if I wanted to become her assistant! I said no, of course, I'm too busy with the farm.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/1": "Yaaaay!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/2": "A perfect place to introduce ourselves. I'm the scholar Aram, here to research the architectural secrets of the world!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/3": "Keeping it true to life, cool. I'm a birdwatcher by the name of Silver, seeking the legendary Dragonhawk! That's a hawk, not a dragon. Common misunderstanding.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/4": "A birdwatcher and a scholar... did anyone pick a combat class? For ascending the deadly Blood Tower?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/5": "Me! I'm a cool elf who's also a dragon and also a knight. My name is Brightclaw and I have a cool sword and claws and also my mom is here!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/6": "Ahem... yes, I'm Brightclaw's mother, a simple elvish trader... who negotiated a pact with a demon.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/7": "My name is Supreme Warlock Grimblade.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/8": "I'm beginning to understand where Dell's imagination comes from...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_1/balors_gate_1/init": "With Eiland's blessing, I'll be your host for a new adventure! Now, let's set the stage: you stand before an imposing gate, decorated with the bones and blood of fallen adventurers.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/1": "It's because we're on a journey... of knowledge!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/2": "No, it's because I like making friends with all the cool monsters! They told me I'm half-elf, half-dragon, half-knight, and secretly half-unicorn!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/3": "You might be the most magical creature of them all, Brightclaw. But your ma is an elf, so was your pa some kind of... Dragon Unicorn Knight?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/4": "Fascinating question. I'll roll for scholarly insight and draconic knowledge... oh rats, a three. Well, let's inquire with Brightclaw's mother. Grimblade?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/5": "I suppose I can ask. Holt, are you a Dragon Unicorn Knight?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/6": "Whatever you say, honey!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_2/balors_gate_2/init": "Your ragtag group has traveled three floors up the Blood Tower, inexplicably befriending every monster along the way. In fact, I don't think you've fought... anyone?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/1": "Silver is overcome with awe. He approaches reverently and coos, in the manner described in Daffodilia's Guide to Birds Strange and Mundane.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/10": "Oh no, you're not getting out of a fight this time. In fact, this parade of buffoonery enrages the Dragonhawk. Illusion falls away, revealing the Dragonhawk's true identity.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/11": "Demonlord Blood, who built this tower. An architect. An EVIL architect.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/12": "Gasp! My enemy!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/2": "The ancient bird heaves a deep, reverberating sigh. \"Oh dear,\" it says. \"Another fan.\" ",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/4": "Can I be friends with it? Can I pet it? I really want to pet it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/5": "Honey, it's a creature of ancient wisdom and power.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/6": "Besides, you don't know where that legendary bird has been.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/7": "The Dragonhawk hears your insinuations about its hygiene and has judged you... unworthy of giving pets. In fact, it seems quite angry, and begins to shimmer.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/8": "Mooom! You made it angry!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/9": "Don't worry everyone, I'll enthrall this bird with the power of conversation. Aram recounts an architectural treatise on stoneworking, and-",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_3/balors_gate_3/init": "Revelations about Brightclaw's past bring you to the top of the tower, where you finally lay eyes upon it. The legendary Dragonhawk!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/1": "I've got him distracted, at least. He's the demon I made a pact with!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/10": "Ahem. \"You are the worst, most disorganized party to ever enter this tower, and I've paid the price for that. I hope my demise teaches you mortals something.\" ",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/11": "I learned that Blood Tower is named for Lord Blood, and not because it's full of blood.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/12": "I learned that sometimes it's a mistake to meet your heroes, even if that hero is a bird.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/13": "I learned that knowledge can be a weapon! Literally!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/14": "I learned how to make a pact with a demon!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/2": "Apparently he's never met someone who knew the contract better than him!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/3": "Think, guys! That big arch he's sitting on is Alda style. Mister Aram said it relies on a keystone, but I can't hit something so far away!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/4": "Silver can do it. He's so let down by the Dragonhawk, this is his origin story... this is how he becomes a DARK BIRDWATCHER. I activate Shadow Eye and shoot the keystone!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/5": "A class change in the middle of battle? I'll allow it. The keystone shatters!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/6": "Demonlord Blood falls to the ground, trapped by his awkward conversation with Supreme Grimblade, made even more awkward by his graceless tumble.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/7": "I roll to show Demonlord Blood the pages of my architectural digest, hoping to turn him from the ways of evil architecture. I rolled a... twenty?!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/8": "The digest slips from your hand, striking Blood's weak spot. The demon coughs and begins to burn with demonic fire. He rasps his final words at you.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/9": "Do the voice!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Balor's Gate/balors_gate_4/balors_gate_4/init": "Friends, I must apologize... my eagerness to study the tower led to our capture by Demonlord Blood. Look at us now. Defeated. And we've learned nothing!",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/3": "Oh, that tastes just heavenly! Try this, [Ari]!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/4": "Hot, sweet and fruity, with a little bite... that's whiskey, I surmise?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/5": "It's like hot tea with a little something extra! More of that extra for me, please.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/6": "I want to wrap myself up in this drink like a blanket, it's so cozy! What is it?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/7": "Hot toddy. Hot water, lemon, honey, and a splash of whatever you like. Thought something simple after a complicated week was just the thing.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/8": "Maybe you're right. And you know, I think it's very important I quality control this drink.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/9": "That'd be mighty helpful of you.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/init": "Ohhh, I know that look, Adeline, you're thinking of going back to work! Keep your behind parked in that chair!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/1": "I'm overrun with mint this year! Hayden called it a bumper crop. I brought more, take it!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/2": "Nice, I can pretty up drinks with the fresh stuff. And... there we are, mint gimlets all around. Give them a go!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/3": "Oh! It's so cute! And green! And it tastes so minty! And herby!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/4": "And fresh! And limey!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/5": "Hemlock used to mix me one of these after a long, hot day in the Mines. Oh, happy days... no matter the time of year, this is the taste of summer!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/6": "It's so refreshing! This drink and I were mint to be together.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/7": "Thanks to Celine, I've got it bottled up behind the counter now, so come back for the taste of summer any time. You too, [Ari]!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/init": "Thanks for bringing all that mint by earlier this week, Celine. Reina cooked it down and got a nice syrup out of it, so we've got something special today.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/1": "I know you're a coffee fan, so I've been experimenting since last time I saw Darcy at the Market. Took weeks to get the flavor right!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/10": "Not even a pun? Now that's a first.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/2": "Now, we've got two to one of our base liquor and the coffee liqueur, over ice. That's a nice molasses color, isn't it?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/3": "It looks a bit... bitter. Unless...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/4": "You know it. Reina whipped up some sweet heavy cream for us. Now, a big, generous ladle on top...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/5": "Oh my gosh. It looks scrumptious!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/6": "You're an artist, Hemlock. Cheers!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/7": "Look at the cream blend with the coffee! It looks like a heavy mist over the mountains...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/8": "Now that's a pretty name. We'll call it a Heavy Mist! So, what do you think Holt?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/9": "Can't! Talk! Too... busy... drinking!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/init": "You absolute madman. You did it. Coffee liqueur!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/1": "This is something we used to make after a long day in the Mines. It went by many names! Rock Juice, the Mineshaft, Blood from the Stone, the Sinkhole...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/10": "Oh, you're all giving up in favor a normal drink? That's how we did it in the old days, too.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/11": "What about you, [Ari]? You can have a beer, but someone's got to, ah, handle this Bucket Brew.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/11/prompts/0": "Bucket Brew me!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/11/prompts/1": "I'll stick with beer.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/12": "Hoho, you're an adventurous one! That's the spirit!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/13": "You've wisdom beyond your years, [Ari].",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/2": "Helmet Hash, Miner's Mash, Bucket Brew...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/3": "So what was the recipe?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/4": "Well, it wasn't a recipe so much as we all poured whatever dregs we had into a canteen and gave it a good shake!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/5": "Errol, as the one responsible for the wellbeing of this town, I have to ask. What was safer, the Mines or this drink?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/6": "Hah! You're quite a card, Lady Adeline.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/7": "He didn't answer the question, did he?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/8": "He sure didn't...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/9": "How about a round of beers instead?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/init": "Hemlock's been so generously mixing the drinks the past few weeks, I thought I'd share a recipe of my own!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/1": "I joined the drawing club because I want to start sketching my animals. They grow up so fast, you know?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/2": "Valen's the model this week! I thought she'd be quite stiff, but she actually seems very comfortable in her poses.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/3": "An understanding of muscle groups is a must in my line of work. Now, are you ready? Next pose!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/4": "Wait, I'm still drawing! I can't create a masterpiece under these conditions.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/5": "It's not about creating a masterpiece, March! It's about having fun and spending time with your big bro!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/6": "It's not about being the best at drawing?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/7": "I see. So it's about being the best at having fun and hanging out.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/init": "Welcome to the first drawing club session of the season, [Ari]! We've got all kinds of talents here.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/1": "Between you and me, my back seized up ten minutes ago and now I'm stuck like this.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/2": "I heard that, and I'll take a look when we're done here. But for now, why don't we peek at everyone's drawings?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/3": "I like Landen's! You can see his carpenter's hand in it. Is it all those years of technical drawing, Landen?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/4": "You got me, lady. In case you're wondering, a clean line is all in the shoulder. Which I can see you've taken to heart, March! Big improvement!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/5": "Th-thanks. I mean, it's only natural, right? And speaking of natural, Valen... your drawings are something else.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/6": "Oh, thank you March. I was just thinking that Elsie's portraits are so striking. She really draws out the... charm points of her subject.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/7": "Are my pecs really that big?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/8": "Did you do some drawing down on the farm, big guy? The baby animals in your sketchbook are WAY cute.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/9": "I wanted a memento from when they're tiny! These drawings are nothing special... not as special as I'd like. Now, can someone get some ice for my back?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/init": "I'm the model this week! You might be wondering how can I hold this pose for so long...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/1": "My drawings are pretty bad, but I'll try to do you justice, Elsie!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/2": "Hayden, if I could point something out. I noticed you've got a habit of putting your own drawings down.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/3": "You avoid sharing them, too... It's important to take pride in what you do.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/4": "Aaand?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/5": "And to have fun, too. I guess.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/6": "My goodness, March. As a doctor, I'm afraid I have to diagnose you with a growth... of character.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/7": "What you're all saying is tough medicine, but don't think I'm not taking it to heart! If even stubborn young March can change, then your ol' friend Hayden can too.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/8": "Yeah, exactly!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/9": "Hey, wait a minute...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/init": "I'm having such fun being this week's model, [Ari]! Between performing in the opera and walking the red carpet, I'm no stranger to striking a pose!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/1": "Thanks, I put a lot of work into my traps! Okay, I better make way for this week's real model.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/2": "Cluck cluck!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/3": "I like your attitude, young lady. And what a lovely pose... you're giving us so much wing!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/4": "How is Henrietta such a dynamic model?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/5": "Thanks for sharing this with us, Hayden. Seems awful special to you.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/6": "I've seen so many animals grow up since I took the farm over. Thought it might be nice to start sketching up some memories.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/7": "Before I knew it, I was sketching all by myself and got in my own head about it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/8": "Thanks for talking some sense into me! You reminded me I'm the sharing type, and drawing's more fun with friends besides. Isn't that right, [Ari]?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/9": "GYA HA HA!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/init": "Excellent contrapposto, Olric!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Inn Keepers/inn_keepers/inn_keepers_josephine/init": "Juniper and Terithia look thick as thieves up there on the balcony! What do you suppose they're talking about?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Inn Keepers/inn_keepers/inn_keepers_luc/init": "Miss Terithia looks like a sailor when she leans over the balcony! It's like she's on a ship!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Inn Keepers/inn_keepers/inn_keepers_maple/1": "Anyway, that's how I know Miss Juniper and Miss Terithia are both up on the balcony.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Inn Keepers/inn_keepers/inn_keepers_maple/init": "I once asked Mama why Miss Juniper and Miss Terithia laugh like that, and Mama told me to shush and be polite."
