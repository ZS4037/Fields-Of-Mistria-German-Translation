    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/3": "Oh, that tastes just heavenly! Try this, [Ari]!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/4": "Hot, sweet and fruity, with a little bite... that's whiskey, I surmise?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/5": "It's like hot tea with a little something extra! More of that extra for me, please.",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/7": "Hot toddy. Hot water, lemon, honey, and a splash of whatever you like. Thought something simple after a complicated week was just the thing.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_1/cocktails_1/8": "Maybe you're right. And you know, I think it's very important I quality control this drink.",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/4": "And fresh! And limey!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_2/cocktails_2/5": "Hemlock used to mix me one of these after a long, hot day in the Mines. Oh, happy days... no matter the time of year, this is the taste of summer!",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/2": "Now, we've got two to one of our base liquor and the coffee liqueur, over ice. That's a nice molasses color, isn't it?",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/4": "You know it. Reina whipped up some sweet heavy cream for us. Now, a big, generous ladle on top...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/5": "Oh my gosh. It looks scrumptious!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/6": "You're an artist, Hemlock. Cheers!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_3/cocktails_3/7": "Look at the cream blend with the coffee! It looks like a heavy mist over the mountains...",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/1": "This is something we used to make after a long day in the Mines. It went by many names! Rock Juice, the Mineshaft, Blood from the Stone, the Sinkhole...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/10": "Oh, you're all giving up in favor a normal drink? That's how we did it in the old days, too.",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/4": "Well, it wasn't a recipe so much as we all poured whatever dregs we had into a canteen and gave it a good shake!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/5": "Errol, as the one responsible for the wellbeing of this town, I have to ask. What was safer, the Mines or this drink?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/6": "Hah! You're quite a card, Lady Adeline.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/7": "He didn't answer the question, did he?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/8": "He sure didn't...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/9": "How about a round of beers instead?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Cocktails/cocktails_4/cocktails_4/init": "Hemlock's been so generously mixing the drinks the past few weeks, I thought I'd share a recipe of my own!",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/5": "It's not about creating a masterpiece, March! It's about having fun and spending time with your big bro!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/6": "It's not about being the best at drawing?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/7": "I see. So it's about being the best at having fun and hanging out.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_1/drawing_1/init": "Welcome to the first drawing club session of the season, [Ari]! We've got all kinds of talents here.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/1": "Between you and me, my back seized up ten minutes ago and now I'm stuck like this.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/2": "I heard that, and I'll take a look when we're done here. But for now, why don't we peek at everyone's drawings?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/3": "I like Landen's! You can see his carpenter's hand in it. Is it all those years of technical drawing, Landen?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/4": "You got me, lady. In case you're wondering, a clean line is all in the shoulder. Which I can see you've taken to heart, March! Big improvement!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/5": "Th-thanks. I mean, it's only natural, right? And speaking of natural, Valen... your drawings are something else.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/6": "Oh, thank you March. I was just thinking that Elsie's portraits are so striking. She really draws out the... charm points of her subject.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/7": "Are my pecs really that big?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/8": "Did you do some drawing down on the farm, big guy? The baby animals in your sketchbook are WAY cute.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/9": "I wanted a memento from when they're tiny! These drawings are nothing special... not as special as I'd like. Now, can someone get some ice for my back?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_2/drawing_2/init": "I'm the model this week! You might be wondering how can I hold this pose for so long...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/1": "My drawings are pretty bad, but I'll try to do you justice, Elsie!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/2": "Hayden, if I could point something out. I noticed you've got a habit of putting your own drawings down.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/3": "You avoid sharing them, too... It's important to take pride in what you do.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/4": "Aaand?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/5": "And to have fun, too. I guess.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/6": "My goodness, March. As a doctor, I'm afraid I have to diagnose you with a growth... of character.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/7": "What you're all saying is tough medicine, but don't think I'm not taking it to heart! If even stubborn young March can change, then your ol' friend Hayden can too.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/8": "Yeah, exactly!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/9": "Hey, wait a minute...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_3/drawing_3/init": "I'm having such fun being this week's model, [Ari]! Between performing in the opera and walking the red carpet, I'm no stranger to striking a pose!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/1": "Thanks, I put a lot of work into my traps! Okay, I better make way for this week's real model.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/2": "Cluck cluck!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/3": "I like your attitude, young lady. And what a lovely pose... you're giving us so much wing!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/4": "How is Henrietta such a dynamic model?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/5": "Thanks for sharing this with us, Hayden. Seems awful special to you.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/6": "I've seen so many animals grow up since I took the farm over. Thought it might be nice to start sketching up some memories.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/7": "Before I knew it, I was sketching all by myself and got in my own head about it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/8": "Thanks for talking some sense into me! You reminded me I'm the sharing type, and drawing's more fun with friends besides. Isn't that right, [Ari]?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/9": "GYA HA HA!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Drawing Club/drawing_4/drawing_4/init": "Excellent contrapposto, Olric!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Inn Keepers/inn_keepers/inn_keepers_josephine/init": "Juniper and Terithia look thick as thieves up there on the balcony! What do you suppose they're talking about?",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Inn Keepers/inn_keepers/inn_keepers_maple/1": "Anyway, that's how I know Miss Juniper and Miss Terithia are both up on the balcony.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 2/Inn Keepers/inn_keepers/inn_keepers_maple/init": "I once asked Mama why Miss Juniper and Miss Terithia laugh like that, and Mama told me to shush and be polite.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/1": "Lords of the Land... Hm. Can't say I'm familiar with it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/2": "It was locked in a chest, which was a bit odd. Anyway, all of the pieces were present and accounted for.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/3": "Do you suppose we could play it? It might open up a whole new avenue of research.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/4": "So we each pick a game piece to represent us on the board? Oh, I want the flower!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/5": "It's a daffodil, Mom. And really? That... that's my game piece! That's me!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/6": "I suppose I'll be the jester's cap.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/7": "Now Eiland, if there's a jester around these parts, it would be yours truly.",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/9": "Hm. Perhaps there was a reason this game was locked up...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/init": "I found an old board game in the museum archives! Look at this.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/1": "What's riveting is the fact that Eiland is buying up all this property and then sitting on it! Surely you can find a use for your empire?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/10": "I wonder if there's more to Lords of the Land than we think.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/2": "But I have, Nora! It's my duty to preserve these historical buildings. I'm leaving them intact.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/3": "But you had it all declared landmarks! No one has any place to live!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/4": "That's why Celine and I pooled our black market bucks to get around the law. You see, Eiland may have bought the buildings, but I bought the deeds to the land.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/5": "I'm going to level it to make room for my newest development... an amusement park!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/6": "Welcome... to Holtland.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/7": "You said we'd call it Celineland!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/8": "For a silly little board game, it certainly induces people to act unlike themselves.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/9": "It raises the collective blood pressure of the table, too...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/init": "This game is riveting, Eiland. You said it's called Lords of the Land?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/1": "Apparently this game is outlawed in seven countries, four provinces and two city-states. It has a storied history of turning neighbor against neighbor.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/10": "This has been simply fascinating. I wonder if I might take the game home with me?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/11": "I'd love to study it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/2": "Of course, we live in more civilized times, so no need to let that ruin the fun!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/3": "Fun? FUN? You think the woodworker's district burning down in the last game was fun?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/4": "It only burned down because you were courting the reformed thieves guild in hopes of swindling them out of their property.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/5": "Instead, they came after you! For revenge!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/6": "We don't take kindly to being tricked, Dad. You should have taken the deal. It was an honest offer.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/7": "Actually, it was a bit outrageous as offers go... you overvalued that real estate at least twice over.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/8": "We're a reformed thieves guild, Eiland... not fools.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/9": "Do you take us for fools, Eiland?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/init": "I uncovered some interesting facts about Lords of the Land in the past week!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/1": "It's true! Reina really outdid herself. And Eiland, this tea is so lovely and floral! Thank you for sharing it with us.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/2": "Of course! Good things are meant to be shared.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/3": "Weren't we playing a board game, though?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/4": "That's right! Lords of the Land. Didn't Valen take it home last time?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/5": "I threw it in the river.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/6": "You threw a historical artifact... in the river?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/7": "It seemed the best place for it. And look at us! We're all getting along quite nicely.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/8": "But Valen... what happens when it washes up in the next town over?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/9": "It'll tear that village apart!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/init": "These shortcakes are delicious, Celine.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/1": "Now, let's introduce our first book! Terithia picked Tales of the Sea, a collection of fishy folktales. Tell me about your favorite story!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/2": "I quite liked the Ballad of the Sea Cucumber. For a story with such an adorable premise, the sense of melancholy at the close is what made it stick out in my mind.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/3": "Oh yeah, I liked that one. My favorite was the one about the three pirates. I had no idea who was going to end up captain in the end!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/4": "To be frank, I've been on ships like that.",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/6": "I was partial to the Siren's Song story! I could relate, I'm not immune to a charming face and a pretty ditty!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/7": "You'd walk right into the ocean, I suspect.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/8": "Lucky for me I'm such a strong swimmer!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/init": "Oh, it is so exciting to welcome you to book club! I ran one in the Capital, too... I find discussion helps stimulate my mind as I formulate my memoirs!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/1": "I've been dying to talk about this book all week! I started reading right after our last session, and I couldn't put it down! The twists! The turns!",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/2": "Let's use the treasure to invest towards Mistria's development. Putting the resources into something the whole town can enjoy would make it everyone's treasure!",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/3": "We did it!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/4": "And the bad news?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/5": "The family is aware of the painting... and despises it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/6": "Oh. I suppose his descendants want nothing to do with their clownish history...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/7": "So... what do we do with it?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/8": "Well, the Hawthornes said it was a political liability. They want it destroyed.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/9": "I don't have the heart to do that, but maybe we can bury it. I'll get a shovel.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/9/prompts/0": "Wait! I'll take it!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/9/prompts/1": "That's probably for the best.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/init": "Good evening, my detectives! I come bearing good news and bad news.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Inn Crew/inn_crew/inn_crew_1/1": "I think Dell is pretending to be a... standoffish cat? Or is she pretending to be March?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Inn Crew/inn_crew/inn_crew_1/init": "Are the kids playing a game up on the balcony?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Inn Crew/inn_crew/inn_crew_2/1": "Their faces are so intense, I'm getting chills! Ooh, I hope they crack the case!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Inn Crew/inn_crew/inn_crew_2/init": "That table over there... Balor, Nora and company. They look like they're trying to solve some kind of mystery.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Inn Crew/inn_crew/inn_crew_3/1": "Sure does. I wonder what kind of adventure Elsie's got in store for them this week?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Inn Crew/inn_crew/inn_crew_3/init": "The game table looks like it's heating up, doesn't it?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Inn Crew/inn_crew/inn_crew_4/1": "Oh, come now dear. It was Eiland's scheme for sharing unlimited desserts.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Inn Crew/inn_crew/inn_crew_4/init": "You don't suppose the desserts club was Eiland's scheme for getting unlimited desserts, do you?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/1": "But we'll make up for it with plenty of drama! Let's get started shall we? Everyone grab one of these note cards I've prepared, each will describe your character's secret lover!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/10": "Penelope? Just like that? I thought I was too grizzled to be this devastated.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/11": "Pen would never break up with me in this manner. There must be something else going on!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/12": "Was Penny playing with Goldwolf's heart? Is this even how you're supposed to play this game? Goldwolf feels rage and sorrow, and wants answers!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/13": "Whoa, guys... hang on...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/14": "Were we all dating the same person?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/15": "Kid, I think you're onto something.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/16": "Just who are you, Penelope Lovestruck?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/2": "Now, I'll set the scene. You're all at the same restaurant, awaiting the arrival of your respective dates. The atmosphere is cheerful, and you've got to chatting.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/3": "The waiter poses a friendly question: Who are you? and what is it that you love about your secret date?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/4": "The name's Chip Rosewood, retired detective. It's hard to find someone who really gets you in my line of work. And according to this here note card, she knows how to hold her liquor to boot!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/5": "I am known as the sorceress Anelace. My darling has an inquisitive mind! She always asks after my latest spells, and she's even inspired me to create some new ones... apparently.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/6": "I'm Goldwolf, a barbarian warrior! Goldwolf loves her girlfriend because she's hotter than the volcanoes that rise above her homeland.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/7": "Right on, Goldwolf. I'm Rocky, a wandering monk who worships the buffest god, Musculor. I met my girl at the monastery gym! She's strong!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/8": "The waiter listens raptly, until he's distracted by a messenger with a letter. He frowns, and reads the letter aloud.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/9": "\"To whom it concerns: Forgive me for missing our date. Things must end between us. Don't come looking for me. Signed, Penelope Lovestruck.\" ",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/init": "Oh, I'm so excited to be running this round of Dragons and Drama! Though if I'm honest, this campaign is a little light on the dragons.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/1": "Your shared purpose is to find answers to the mystery of Penelope Lovestruck... but a close second is brunch.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/10": "The fellow keeps peeking over at you, but he's being awfully subtle about it. It's only due to your years of experience that you've noticed.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/11": "Oh, should I not be waving at him?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/12": "That must be why he's getting his things together rather quickly. We should follow him.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/13": "Yeehaw! It's on! We'll find you, Penelope!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/2": "Sorceress Anelace finds a refreshing morning salad is the most efficient way to keep her mana topped up.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/3": "Goldwolf thinks Anelace is not very well-versed in the intricacies of mana management. Maybe she'd like pointers.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/4": "Anelace isn't about to start taking magical instruction from a barbarian.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/5": "Pass those hard-boiled eggs, Chip. They look so good after a long morning of muscle prayers at the temple bench press!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/6": "Alright, enough chit-chat! Penelope was a regular at this very diner. I've been showing this drawing of her around, and that man at the counter had a very interesting reaction.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/7": "Goldwolf thinks his reaction may be due to your terrible drawing.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/8": "It's quite abysmal.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/9": "Ah, everyone's a critic. I roll to surreptitiously observe the suspicious man. What's an eleven do for us?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/init": "One week has passed, and your group of circumstance has gathered at a diner.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/1": "But lo! An oxcart blocks the street in front of you! You watch helplessly as your quarry disappears into the crowd beyond.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/10": "His disorientation is an advantage for my spell of truth! I weave it around him before he has a chance to get his thoughts in order.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/11": "Goldwolf would like to point out that truth is better extracted with a potion than a spell.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/12": "Anelace would like to point out that she doesn't tell Goldwolf how to throw heavy objects.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/13": "The truth comes out slowly, carefully, as though the man is piecing it together himself.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/14": "Penelope Lovestruck was a spy for the crown, and this man is Hans, her handler! If she's missing, it means something's gone terribly wrong.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/15": "Hans wants to recruit you to a clandestine effort to get Penelope back... Operation: Lovestruck!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/16": "And here I thought I was retired. Guess it's time... for one last job.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/2": "Rats! That was our best lead!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/3": "Goldwolf thinks you give up too easily. She lifts the oxcart and throws it aside, roaring the battlecry of her homeland!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/4": "OHOHOHO!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/5": "Oh my! How delightfully unexpected. The melons in the cart are sent flying, and the way is opened to you once more!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/6": "Enhance! I roll to use my Bifocal Eagle Eye, hoping to pick this guy out of the crowd before he's gone for good. Ooh, a high roll! There, Rocky! Get 'im!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/7": "I'm on it! I call on the teachings of Musculor the muscle god to activate the hidden potential of my glutes.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/8": "I vault over the crowd, kicking off of a fruit stand so I can grab one of those melons in mid-air! I roll to throw it at him!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/9": "Your roll isn't high, but this is so delightful I'll allow it. The mighty melon sends the man prone. He's startled, and covered in a fine patina of cantaloupe.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/init": "Your motley crew bursts out of the diner, in pursuit of the suspicious fellow who balked at Chip's drawing of Penelope Lovestruck.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/1": "You've found Penelope, and she wasn't captured at all! She fell in love with the agent of a rival nation, and fled because her handler, Hans, branded her a traitor.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/10": "The spell wipes the man's mind! Penelope and her love abscond into the night, to start their new life.... At least until she's bored again.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/11": "And it's all thanks to you warriors of the heart!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/12": "Wonderful, wonderful! I've never done an interactive story before, but you made it such fun!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/13": "You did a great job, Elsie. I was thinking about the adventures of Chip Rosewood all week, every week!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/14": "That warms my heart. And you know, this adventure was largely autobiographical.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/15": "I see! Wait, what?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/16": "Somehow, Goldwolf is not surprised.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/2": "In fact, Penelope seems quite repentant. And torn. She loved Chip Rosewood's reliable experience, and adored Anelace's boundless curiosity.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/3": "She was fascinated by Goldwolf's stories of her barbarian homeland, and she was enthralled by the strength of Rocky's brain.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/4": "Sigh... she always was a sweetheart, that Penelope. Well, folks... I think we know what we have to do.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/5": "Goldwolf hates betrayal... but loves the juicy drama of forbidden love. Goldwolf votes to keep Hans at bay, so Penny and her newest flame can escape.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/6": "I use my powerful brain to headbutt the bad guy, so Anelace has time to cast a cool spell!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/7": "The precepts of my magical school demand that I help anyone in need. I weave a spell of memory obliteration on the spy handler.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/8": "Unless Goldwolf objects?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/9": "Oh, no. Goldwolf thinks memory obliteration sounds delightful.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/init": "You've all embarked on Operation: Lovestruck, to save your missing lover and serial dater Penelope Lovestruck. But things have gone horribly awry!"
