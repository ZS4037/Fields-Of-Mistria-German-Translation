    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/7": "So... what do we do with it?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/8": "Well, the Hawthornes said it was a political liability. They want it destroyed.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/9": "I don't have the heart to do that, but maybe we can bury it. I'll get a shovel.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/9/prompts/0": "Wait! I'll take it!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/9/prompts/1": "That's probably for the best.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Detectives/detectives_4/detectives_4/init": "Good evening, my detectives! I come bearing good news and bad news.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Inn Crew/inn_crew/inn_crew_1/1": "I think Dell is pretending to be a... standoffish cat? Or is she pretending to be March?",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Inn Crew/inn_crew/inn_crew_2/1": "Their faces are so intense, I'm getting chills! Ooh, I hope they crack the case!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Inn Crew/inn_crew/inn_crew_2/init": "That table over there... Balor, Nora and company. They look like they're trying to solve some kind of mystery.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Inn Crew/inn_crew/inn_crew_3/1": "Sure does. I wonder what kind of adventure Elsie's got in store for them this week?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Inn Crew/inn_crew/inn_crew_3/init": "The game table looks like it's heating up, doesn't it?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Inn Crew/inn_crew/inn_crew_4/1": "Oh, come now dear. It was Eiland's scheme for sharing unlimited desserts.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Inn Crew/inn_crew/inn_crew_4/init": "You don't suppose the desserts club was Eiland's scheme for getting unlimited desserts, do you?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/1": "But we'll make up for it with plenty of drama! Let's get started shall we? Everyone grab one of these note cards I've prepared, each will describe your character's secret lover!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/10": "Penelope? Just like that? I thought I was too grizzled to be this devastated.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/11": "Pen would never break up with me in this manner. There must be something else going on!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/12": "Was Penny playing with Goldwolf's heart? Is this even how you're supposed to play this game? Goldwolf feels rage and sorrow, and wants answers!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/13": "Whoa, guys... hang on...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/14": "Were we all dating the same person?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/15": "Kid, I think you're onto something.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/16": "Just who are you, Penelope Lovestruck?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/2": "Now, I'll set the scene. You're all at the same restaurant, awaiting the arrival of your respective dates. The atmosphere is cheerful, and you've got to chatting.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/3": "The waiter poses a friendly question: Who are you? and what is it that you love about your secret date?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/4": "The name's Chip Rosewood, retired detective. It's hard to find someone who really gets you in my line of work. And according to this here note card, she knows how to hold her liquor to boot!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/5": "I am known as the sorceress Anelace. My darling has an inquisitive mind! She always asks after my latest spells, and she's even inspired me to create some new ones... apparently.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/6": "I'm Goldwolf, a barbarian warrior! Goldwolf loves her girlfriend because she's hotter than the volcanoes that rise above her homeland.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/7": "Right on, Goldwolf. I'm Rocky, a wandering monk who worships the buffest god, Musculor. I met my girl at the monastery gym! She's strong!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/8": "The waiter listens raptly, until he's distracted by a messenger with a letter. He frowns, and reads the letter aloud.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/9": "\"To whom it concerns: Forgive me for missing our date. Things must end between us. Don't come looking for me. Signed, Penelope Lovestruck.\" ",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_1/operation_lovestruck_1/init": "Oh, I'm so excited to be running this round of Dragons and Drama! Though if I'm honest, this campaign is a little light on the dragons.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/1": "Your shared purpose is to find answers to the mystery of Penelope Lovestruck... but a close second is brunch.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/10": "The fellow keeps peeking over at you, but he's being awfully subtle about it. It's only due to your years of experience that you've noticed.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/11": "Oh, should I not be waving at him?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/12": "That must be why he's getting his things together rather quickly. We should follow him.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/13": "Yeehaw! It's on! We'll find you, Penelope!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/2": "Sorceress Anelace finds a refreshing morning salad is the most efficient way to keep her mana topped up.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/3": "Goldwolf thinks Anelace is not very well-versed in the intricacies of mana management. Maybe she'd like pointers.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/4": "Anelace isn't about to start taking magical instruction from a barbarian.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/5": "Pass those hard-boiled eggs, Chip. They look so good after a long morning of muscle prayers at the temple bench press!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/6": "Alright, enough chit-chat! Penelope was a regular at this very diner. I've been showing this drawing of her around, and that man at the counter had a very interesting reaction.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/7": "Goldwolf thinks his reaction may be due to your terrible drawing.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/8": "It's quite abysmal.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/9": "Ah, everyone's a critic. I roll to surreptitiously observe the suspicious man. What's an eleven do for us?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_2/operation_lovestruck_2/init": "One week has passed, and your group of circumstance has gathered at a diner.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/1": "But lo! An oxcart blocks the street in front of you! You watch helplessly as your quarry disappears into the crowd beyond.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/10": "His disorientation is an advantage for my spell of truth! I weave it around him before he has a chance to get his thoughts in order.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/11": "Goldwolf would like to point out that truth is better extracted with a potion than a spell.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/12": "Anelace would like to point out that she doesn't tell Goldwolf how to throw heavy objects.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/13": "The truth comes out slowly, carefully, as though the man is piecing it together himself.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/14": "Penelope Lovestruck was a spy for the crown, and this man is Hans, her handler! If she's missing, it means something's gone terribly wrong.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/15": "Hans wants to recruit you to a clandestine effort to get Penelope back... Operation: Lovestruck!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/16": "And here I thought I was retired. Guess it's time... for one last job.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/2": "Rats! That was our best lead!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/3": "Goldwolf thinks you give up too easily. She lifts the oxcart and throws it aside, roaring the battlecry of her homeland!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/4": "OHOHOHO!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/5": "Oh my! How delightfully unexpected. The melons in the cart are sent flying, and the way is opened to you once more!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/6": "Enhance! I roll to use my Bifocal Eagle Eye, hoping to pick this guy out of the crowd before he's gone for good. Ooh, a high roll! There, Rocky! Get 'im!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/7": "I'm on it! I call on the teachings of Musculor the muscle god to activate the hidden potential of my glutes.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/8": "I vault over the crowd, kicking off of a fruit stand so I can grab one of those melons in mid-air! I roll to throw it at him!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/9": "Your roll isn't high, but this is so delightful I'll allow it. The mighty melon sends the man prone. He's startled, and covered in a fine patina of cantaloupe.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_3/operation_lovestruck_3/init": "Your motley crew bursts out of the diner, in pursuit of the suspicious fellow who balked at Chip's drawing of Penelope Lovestruck.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/1": "You've found Penelope, and she wasn't captured at all! She fell in love with the agent of a rival nation, and fled because her handler, Hans, branded her a traitor.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/10": "The spell wipes the man's mind! Penelope and her love abscond into the night, to start their new life.... At least until she's bored again.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/11": "And it's all thanks to you warriors of the heart!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/12": "Wonderful, wonderful! I've never done an interactive story before, but you made it such fun!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/13": "You did a great job, Elsie. I was thinking about the adventures of Chip Rosewood all week, every week!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/14": "That warms my heart. And you know, this adventure was largely autobiographical.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/15": "I see! Wait, what?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/16": "Somehow, Goldwolf is not surprised.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/2": "In fact, Penelope seems quite repentant. And torn. She loved Chip Rosewood's reliable experience, and adored Anelace's boundless curiosity.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/3": "She was fascinated by Goldwolf's stories of her barbarian homeland, and she was enthralled by the strength of Rocky's brain.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/4": "Sigh... she always was a sweetheart, that Penelope. Well, folks... I think we know what we have to do.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/5": "Goldwolf hates betrayal... but loves the juicy drama of forbidden love. Goldwolf votes to keep Hans at bay, so Penny and her newest flame can escape.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/6": "I use my powerful brain to headbutt the bad guy, so Anelace has time to cast a cool spell!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/7": "The precepts of my magical school demand that I help anyone in need. I weave a spell of memory obliteration on the spy handler.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/8": "Unless Goldwolf objects?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/9": "Oh, no. Goldwolf thinks memory obliteration sounds delightful.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 4/Operation Lovestruck/operation_lovestruck_4/operation_lovestruck_4/init": "You've all embarked on Operation: Lovestruck, to save your missing lover and serial dater Penelope Lovestruck. But things have gone horribly awry!"
