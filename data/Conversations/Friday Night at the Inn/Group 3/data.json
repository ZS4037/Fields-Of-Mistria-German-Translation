    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/3": "Do you suppose we could play it? It might open up a whole new avenue of research.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/4": "So we each pick a game piece to represent us on the board? Oh, I want the flower!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/5": "It's a daffodil, Mom. And really? That... that's my game piece! That's me!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/6": "I suppose I'll be the jester's cap.",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/9": "Hm. Perhaps there was a reason this game was locked up...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_1/board_games_1/init": "I found an old board game in the museum archives! Look at this.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/1": "What's riveting is the fact that Eiland is buying up all this property and then sitting on it! Surely you can find a use for your empire?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/10": "I wonder if there's more to Lords of the Land than we think.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/2": "But I have, Nora! It's my duty to preserve these historical buildings. I'm leaving them intact.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/3": "But you had it all declared landmarks! No one has any place to live!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/4": "That's why Celine and I pooled our black market bucks to get around the law. You see, Eiland may have bought the buildings, but I bought the deeds to the land.",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/8": "For a silly little board game, it certainly induces people to act unlike themselves.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/9": "It raises the collective blood pressure of the table, too...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_2/board_games_2/init": "This game is riveting, Eiland. You said it's called Lords of the Land?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/1": "Apparently this game is outlawed in seven countries, four provinces and two city-states. It has a storied history of turning neighbor against neighbor.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/10": "This has been simply fascinating. I wonder if I might take the game home with me?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/11": "I'd love to study it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/2": "Of course, we live in more civilized times, so no need to let that ruin the fun!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/3": "Fun? FUN? You think the woodworker's district burning down in the last game was fun?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/4": "It only burned down because you were courting the reformed thieves guild in hopes of swindling them out of their property.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/5": "Instead, they came after you! For revenge!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/6": "We don't take kindly to being tricked, Dad. You should have taken the deal. It was an honest offer.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/7": "Actually, it was a bit outrageous as offers go... you overvalued that real estate at least twice over.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/8": "We're a reformed thieves guild, Eiland... not fools.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/9": "Do you take us for fools, Eiland?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_3/board_games_3/init": "I uncovered some interesting facts about Lords of the Land in the past week!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/1": "It's true! Reina really outdid herself. And Eiland, this tea is so lovely and floral! Thank you for sharing it with us.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/2": "Of course! Good things are meant to be shared.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/3": "Weren't we playing a board game, though?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/4": "That's right! Lords of the Land. Didn't Valen take it home last time?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/5": "I threw it in the river.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/6": "You threw a historical artifact... in the river?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/7": "It seemed the best place for it. And look at us! We're all getting along quite nicely.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/8": "But Valen... what happens when it washes up in the next town over?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/9": "It'll tear that village apart!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Board Games/board_games_4/board_games_4/init": "These shortcakes are delicious, Celine.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/1": "Now, let's introduce our first book! Terithia picked Tales of the Sea, a collection of fishy folktales. Tell me about your favorite story!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/2": "I quite liked the Ballad of the Sea Cucumber. For a story with such an adorable premise, the sense of melancholy at the close is what made it stick out in my mind.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/3": "Oh yeah, I liked that one. My favorite was the one about the three pirates. I had no idea who was going to end up captain in the end!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/4": "To be frank, I've been on ships like that.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/5": "KYA HA HA!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/6": "I was partial to the Siren's Song story! I could relate, I'm not immune to a charming face and a pretty ditty!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/7": "You'd walk right into the ocean, I suspect.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/8": "Lucky for me I'm such a strong swimmer!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_1/book_club_1/init": "Oh, it is so exciting to welcome you to book club! I ran one in the Capital, too... I find discussion helps stimulate my mind as I formulate my memoirs!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/1": "I've been dying to talk about this book all week! I started reading right after our last session, and I couldn't put it down! The twists! The turns!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/2": "I love a closed room mystery, and setting it on a ship was so cool.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/3": "When they said the first murder happened on the deck, where it was impossible to hide... I was captivated. I started keeping a journal!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/4": "Then Ryis and I got to talking about it, and we started pinning notes to the wall in my room. I woke up and went to sleep staring at that thing!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/5": "I was a man possessed! I couldn't figure it out!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/6": "The writer also had all the little nautical details down pat. The absentee pennant, the fake murder weapon hidden in the bilge, the landlubber knots being a clue...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/7": "It was very convincing!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/8": "And who would have thought the butler was the murderer? Not me! But it all made sense...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_2/book_club_2/init": "Oh, I can't wait! Let's get this book club started! What did you think of Murder on the Grand Leviathan?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/1": "Yes... unique... rarely have I seen a book written with such, ah... deliberate precision.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/2": "But the diagrams! Illustrations were a welcome addition.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/3": "I thought the author's note at the end was rather romantic. In his heart, he dedicated that building to his wife.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/4": "Even if he was rather dry about it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/5": "See, Ryis? What'd I tell you? We spent a whole summer bonding over that book, and now they're appreciating it too!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/6": "Uncle, it's a technical manual for reconstructing a wooden cathedral... I don't think this is the kind of book Elsie was talking about. Sorry guys, I tried to talk him out of it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/7": "I did enjoy rereading it, though...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_3/book_club_3/init": "So, ah... Landen and Ryis' choice of book was a bit unique, don't ya think?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/1": "The Rise and Fall of House Amore. What a story!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/10": "Would it be too forward to ask for mine to be signed?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/2": "I'll say! This is what book club is all about! Though I don't know how I feel about Ryis reading about all that.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/3": "What are you even talking about? It was hardly lurid.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/4": "Listen to you! In my day that chapter twelve hand-holding scene would have meant a content warning on the cover!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/5": "Anyway! I love a good love triangle. And this one was so good. I really didn't know which way the princess would go!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/6": "The maelstrom of feelings I had at the end! The joy of love realized! The heart, crushed to pieces!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/7": "Aw, you big old softie.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/8": "Elsie, aren't you writing a romance novel? Let's have a special session when it's ready!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/9": "I'm actually writing my memoirs, so there are many romances to speak of. I'm so delighted you're interested! When I'm done, you'll all get a free copy!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Book Club/book_club_4/book_club_4/init": "I'm not one for lovey-dovey stuff, but the book you picked was a real shipsinker, Elsie!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/1": "Isn't that right, Dragonguard recruits?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/10": "Treasure?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/11": "Treasure?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/12": "Hmm. You guys have a long way to go before you're ready to hear about treasure beyond your wildest dreams.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/13": "Now, dragonguard recruits... move out!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/2": "Actually, I was just going to my room.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/3": "I had a question for Adeline...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/4": "It's more like I'm here to recruit the Dragonguard?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/5": "For new duties! Like litter pickup!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/6": "Don't worry, Dell. I'm here because I totally believe in the dragonguys!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/7": "Boy oh boy... I can't say I'm impressed with the quality of recruits these days.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/8": "I guess Olric will be the only one to hear about the treasure I found.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/9": "Treasure?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1/init": "While everyone down there is playing, we're up here doing the real work.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1_follow_up_adeline/1": "Nora is Dell's mother... it's possible, I suppose.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1_follow_up_adeline/init": "Dell mentioned Dragonguard treasure the other day... do you suppose the Dragonguard is financially solvent?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1_follow_up_balor/1": "My mind is racing!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1_follow_up_balor/init": "What could Dell's treasure be? Gems? A cache of tesserae? Ancient coins?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1_follow_up_juniper/1": "Do you know what it is?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1_follow_up_juniper/init": "It's not like I even want to know what Dell's treasure is...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1_follow_up_olric/1": "I bet it's a cool rock!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_1/dragonguard_1_follow_up_olric/init": "What do you think Dell's treasure is?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_2/dragonguard_2/1": "I can't just tell you, Miss Juniper. You have to prove yourselves!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_2/dragonguard_2/2": "It's the Dragonguard's job to help the town. So what have you done for Mistria this week?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_2/dragonguard_2/3": "Well, I coordinated the town's postings for the request board.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_2/dragonguard_2/4": "I sourced and imported a variety of supplies that are otherwise difficult to obtain in Mistria.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_2/dragonguard_2/5": "I trained extra hard this week!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_2/dragonguard_2/6": "I... heroically ordered the most expensive bottle of wine at the inn! Thereby contributing to the great wheel of the Mistrian economy!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_2/dragonguard_2/7": "You're really holding the other recruits back here, Miss Juniper. But I guess we can decide what to do with the treasure... next week.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_2/dragonguard_2/init": "Okay, Dell. It's time we had a talk, grown-up to kid. What's the Dragonguard's treasure?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/1": "Hmm... I'll allow it.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/10": "Wow, these are really cool ideas!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/11": "This is going to be great! Once we find it!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/12": "Find it?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/13": "I forgot where I buried it! And as the new recruits, you guys have to find it and dig it up.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/14": "I see... Well.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/15": "Maybe we can borrow shovels from Eiland...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/2": "Let's use the treasure to invest towards Mistria's development. Putting the resources into something the whole town can enjoy would make it everyone's treasure!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/3": "But Adeline, it's not everyone's treasure, it's the Dragonguard's treasure.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/4": "I propose that the treasure be invested into the Dragonguard's future. A small fortune today could become a vast resource tomorrow.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/5": "With the right guidance from yours truly, of course.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/6": "Give the treasure to me, and I'll let you and your \"Dragonguards\" pester me as much as you like at the bathhouse. This is a great offer.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/7": "What if we asked Reina to make us a huuuuge apple pie, and had a pie eating contest?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/8": "Olric, we're talking about what to do with the treasure.",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Dragonguard/dragonguard_3/dragonguard_3/init": "Since we're deciding what to do with the Dragonguard's treasure this week, we all came up with proposals!",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Inn Work/inn_work/inn_work_3/init": "There's something odd about that board game they're playing over there.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Inn Work/inn_work/inn_work_4/1": "Maybe we can talk her into doing a signing at the Inn! That would be such fun!",

    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/1": "Each of you is here to vie for a chance to become my heir and one day rule over all of Aldaria!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/10": "Aww, come on Reina!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/11": "Hmm, Reina already has my vote. Too bad this isn't a voting game.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/12": "As long as we can still be friends afterward, I guess Lord Beetle is ready to unleash his million strong bug army!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/13": "That's the spirit!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/2": "Of course, anyone who DOESN'T become my heir might be put to death, if reading old history books has taught me anything.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/3": "But that's how royalty does it! Who are we to argue with a system of rule thousands of years old!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/4": "Now would the members of my court please introduce themselves?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/5": "I'm Lord Beetle. Maple, do we really have to be put to death if we lose? I don't wanna do that.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/6": "Ah shucks, little guy! I think Maple-, er Queen Maple, is just setting the tone. Lord Hayword wouldn't harm his fellow courtiers.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/7": "I'm Lord Anvilstrike, and the Queen is right. Only ignominy and death await my foes on the road to becoming heir.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/8": "Well, maybe just exile... or some community service hours.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/9": "I'm Lady Kettle, sister to the Queen. If I win this contest, all your lives will be spared!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_1/maples_reign_1/init": "Hear ye, hear ye, welcome to Queen Maple's game of Succession!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/1": "Lady Kettle's armies are routed, her war engines lie in ruins...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/10": "Now we're talking!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/2": "I shouldn't have picked all those cicadas for my army, they don't even have mouths.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/3": "Aldaria is going to be in a sorry state if any of you get put in charge!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/4": "W-well, maybe by ourselves isn't the way to go about it! What if we all joined forces, for the good of the country?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/5": "Lord Hayword, please stop trying to undermine the iron grip of my rule.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/6": "He does have a point though...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/7": "If only my dependable Lord Anvilstrike hadn't rolled a 1 and accidentally fallen down all those stairs.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/8": "If Lord Anvilstrike regrets anything, it's that he only had one life to lay down for Aldaria.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/9": "Well, maybe your Queen can revive you. But just this once!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_2/maples_reign_2/init": "Wow, you all are REALLY bad at rolling dice. Sheesh!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/1": "Don't give them hope, Queen Maple. My ascension is a forgone conclusion! ",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/10": "And what role will your QUEEN be playing in all of this, pray tell? ",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/11": "Aw shucks, you can still be Queen! We'll just need to make sure this new group agrees with your decisions.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/2": "I keep telling you all, we need to band together. I roll a 19 for persuasion!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/3": "Lord Hayword, I'll allow it, but this had better lead to some betrayal MOST foul.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/4": "Lord Beetle agrees with Lord Hayword! We should form a group of concerned citizens with Mistria's best interests at heart.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/5": "Well, my armies are mostly out of commission, I suppose Lady Kettle is willing to aid her fellow court members.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/6": "Honestly, running a country by yourself seems like a lot of work. Anvilstrike is... Anvil-in.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/7": "I think we have consensus!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/8": "We should probably have more than just nobility on this council though, huh? As it is, we're all thumbs.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/9": "What if we invite merchants? And commoners!",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_3/maples_reign_3/init": "With Lord Anvilstrike's revival, his prowess on the battlefield has shown through. You're all going to need to try a lot harder or he's going to end up my heir.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/1": "Are you all SURE you all don't want to fight to the death instead?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/10": "At any rate, thanks for playing my- er, OUR game, everyone.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/2": "I think your councilors are set on this new path forward, your highness.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/3": "We did it! It's a brand new day for Aldaria! ",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/4": "Isn't everything better when we all work together?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/5": "It definitely changed the game though, huh?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/6": "Maybe I can arrange some war games with the Caldosians.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/7": "I shouldn't have let the Queen tack on that rider ensuring new species are named after her...",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/8": "Well now, I think the \"Monarch Maplefly\" has a nice ring to it, don't you?",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/9": "Definitely.",
    "Conversations/Friday Night at the Inn/Group 3/Maple's Reign/maples_reign_4/maples_reign_4/init": "Okay okay, so my face will be on the money, there will be two national holidays celebrating me every year, and no paperwork, right?"
