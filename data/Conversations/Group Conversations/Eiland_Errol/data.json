    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/archaeology/archaeology/init": "I'm glad we made time to do some digging out here, Errol... it's been a good day for discoveries.",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/attend_museum/attend_museum/1": "I appreciate it, Errol. I'll fill you in on any exciting discoveries!",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/attend_museum/attend_museum/init": "I'll attend to the museum, so you go ahead and focus on the excavation at the Western Ruins.",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/carving_or_lichen/carving_or_lichen/1": "Why, I thought that was lichen! It's a good thing we've got your young eyes, Lord Eiland.",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/carving_or_lichen/carving_or_lichen/init": "It's badly eroded, but I believe there's trace amounts of paint in the crevices of some of these carvings.",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/charcoal_rubbing/charcoal_rubbing/1": "Yes, I see that... most interesting. Could they refer to a place? A person?",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/charcoal_rubbing/charcoal_rubbing/init": "And look here! The charcoal rubbing I took at the western ruins matches the partial manuscript, except for these two characters.",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/debrief/debrief/1": "Look here! This stain indicates it might have been used to store food. Honey, perhaps? I have a file on ancient Aldarian apiaries somewhere here.",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/debrief/debrief/init": "I found a small cache of pottery fragments at the Western dig site. I have some here, but we'll have to take our time excavating the rest.",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/dig_breakfast/dig_breakfast/1": "When you put it like that, it would be irresponsible to not have seconds!",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/dig_breakfast/dig_breakfast/init": "Eat up, Lord Eiland! It's important to have a hearty breakfast before a dig. That's no different from when I worked the mines!",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/drinks_on_me/drinks_on_me/1": "Very gracious of you, Lord Eiland!",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/drinks_on_me/drinks_on_me/init": "Cheers, Errol. Drinks are on me tonight!",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/drinks_on_me/drinks_on_me_2/1": "I couldn't ask for a better collaborator or curator. Your love of history and preservation is a gift to Mistria.",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/drinks_on_me/drinks_on_me_2/2": "Oh, you're too kind Lord Eiland!",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/drinks_on_me/drinks_on_me_2/3": "During my time as the mine's foreman, I did my best to save artifacts I dug up while searching for ore, but I wasn't always successful.",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/drinks_on_me/drinks_on_me_2/4": "Now that I've been behind the curator's desk a few seasons, I can truly say that the work of preservation is quite fulfilling. A dream come true!",

    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/markings/markings/1": "I believe there's a journal of mine we can cross-reference it with! Exciting, isn't it [Ari]?",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/markings/markings/init": "Oh, would you look at this! The markings are only worn along the edge, but otherwise well-preserved.",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/museum_is_hard/museum_is_hard/1": "Me, sir. I did try and warn you.",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/museum_is_hard/museum_is_hard/2": "So you did. Well... it's fun work!",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/museum_is_hard/museum_is_hard/init": "Who knew that starting a museum would be so much work?",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/too_much_paperwork/too_much_paperwork/1": "Now now, young master. It's important that we archive the day's finds. Adeline would be proud of you.",
    "Conversations/Group Conversations/Eiland_Errol/too_much_paperwork/too_much_paperwork/init": "[Ari], does it take a lot of paperwork to run a farm? I'm thinking of changing professions."
